Hello
## PROJECT INSTALLIATION



## NEW PAGE CREATION

First step:
added new register in admin.py


Second step:
added new class in models.py for our new model

Third step:
create url for this model in urls.py

Fourth step:
also create class for our model in file views.py and if the file is detail, then there is also a function 'get_context_data'

Fifth step:
we go to the template folder and create a file with the name we need and already write the HTML code and everything else in it

Sixth step:
if everything is correct, we do makemigrations and migrate to save the code to the database

Seventh step:
run our code and check if everything works

Eight and last step:
when we have completed everything and everything works, we make a PR, i.e. a Pull Request in Git Hub so that other people canwork with our code further
